          <p>
            In order to use Client Portal API, an authenticated brokerage session must be established. 
            The easiest way to check if the current session is authenticated is by making a POST request to the endpoint <b>/iserver/auth/status</b>. 
            If the session is fully authenticated the response will contain the field 'authenticated' set to true. 
            If you are not seeing this, first check the <a href='./quickstart'>Quickstart</a> page for instructions on authenticating your session, or <a href="./authentication">Authentication</a> for common authentication questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> It may take a some time for the <b>/iserver/auth/status</b> endpoint to return a true value for the authentication status when logging in. 
            If you're using Client Portal API for the first time, please allow up to 15 minutes for the session to fully authenticate.

          title: 'Step Two: Call other endpoints',
          content: `
            <p>
              Most endpoints are self-contained, however in a few cases a preceeding endpoint must first be called before calling another endpoint. 
              As an example of this, the <b>/portfolio/accounts</b> endpoint must be called prior to other <b>/portfolio</b> endpoints in an individual account structure, 
              and <b>/portfolio/subaccounts</b> must be called first in an advisor or master account structure. 
              This will return a list of accounts that are valid to use with the other <b>/portfolio</b> endpoints.

            <p>
              When troubleshooting Client Portal API issues, it may sometimes be necessary for our client services team to obtain additional information about the request in the form of a request log. 
              As such you may be asked to generate a request log (HAR) and send it to us.

              This file contains additional information about the network requests that are sent and received by your browser. 
              Your browser can generate such files by recording the content, timeline and status of network requests and responses while the issue occurs.
              Most browsers have an option to preserve logs, which can then be exported. 
              Please see the 'How to generate a HAR file' link in the resources section of this page.
