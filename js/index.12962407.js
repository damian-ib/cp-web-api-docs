Other Interactive Brokers&#39; trading applications such as TWS or IBKR Mobile also utilize a brokerage sessio. </p><p> Note: A given username can only create a single brokerage session at a time, so launching TWS or IBKR mobile will disconnect a brokerage session in the CP API, and vice versa. </p><h3>How long does a session remain authenticated?</h3><p> To ensure client account security, Interactive Brokers&#39; API solutions were designed with the need for the user to manually reauthenticate with the backend on a daily basis. As such, the maximum period of time that the gateway can potentially remain authenticated is 24 hours. Daily maintenance of IBKR&#39;s servers could result in a disconnect earlier than the 24 hour period mentioned above. To mitigate issues that may result from the maintenance period, we recommend scheduling your gateway to restart following the maintenance period. Information on server reset times and system status updates can be found on the <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php" target="_blank">System Status</a> page. </p><p> In addition to the daily reset period, mentioned above, the Client Portal API brokerage session will also timeout if no requests are received within the space of a couple of minutes. In order to prevent the session from timing out, the endpoint /portal/sso/validate can be called on a regular basis. We recommend calling this endpoint approximately every minute. If the brokerage session has timed out, but the session is still connected to the IBKR backend (field &#39;connected&#39;:true in the response to /iserver/auth/status), a new brokerage session can be established by calling the /reauthenticate endpoint. </p><h3>Can I automatically connect my brokerage session?</h3><p> There is currently no mechanism available on Interactive Brokers&#39; end to permit individual clients to automatically reauthenticate with the gateway. OAuth authentication is available, however an institutional account is required. </p><h3>Can I use a third-party solution to automatically reauthenticate the Brokerage Session?</h3><p> Interactive Brokers does not recommend the use of third-party solutions to automatically reauthenticate the gateway session. This can put your account at risk from potentially malicious projects.

The easiest way to check if the current session is authenticated is by calling the endpoint /iserver/auth/status. If the session\n            is fully authenticated the response will contain the field 'authenticated' set to true. If you are not seeing this first check the <a href=\"./authentication\">authentication</a>\n            page for common authentication errors before proceeding with the next steps. One thing to note, is that 'authenticated': true may not return immediately, but after some time. Allow up to 15 minutes\n            when running the API for the first time to authenticate the session.

As an example of this, the /portfolio/accounts endpoint must be called \n              prior to other /portfolio endpoints in an individual account structure, and /portfolio/subaaccounts must be called first in an advisor or master account structure.
